## **About Project :** 
- There was a BattleSystem Class which were longer than 900 lines. I wrote that monolithic class quite some time ago but that doesn't changes the fact that it was a disgrace to Object-Oriented Programming and principles like SOLID. I started refacoring that.
- Scriptables objects are used as data containers for character stats and custom cursor animations
